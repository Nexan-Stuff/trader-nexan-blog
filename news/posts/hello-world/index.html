      <p>Hello to all you special people! My name is Trader Nexan (or at least, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going by here), and I&rsquo;m starting this blog to just have somewhere to write that doesnt put me under any pressure, have social networking features (like Tumblr does), and kind of lets me express my feelings on certain subjects, including Disney, Theme Parks, Technology, and more! Those are just a few examples of my interest, and you&rsquo;ll get a taste of what I like if you read this blog</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how often I&rsquo;ll update this, but expect a few new posts very soonish. Maybe a post about what Disney is doing to Epcot will come? Maybe I&rsquo;ll post audio here (hotlinked from another site, though) on occasion. I don&rsquo;t know!</p>
